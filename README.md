# **Statistical Analysis and Visualization Using R for ADWG Data**

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to perform a comprehensive statistical analysis and data visualization using R on a dataset focusing on **Average Daily Weight Gain (ADWG)** variables. The dataset contains various continuous and categorical variables, analyzed to understand correlations, differences across treatments, and gender comparisons.

## **Steps & Methods Used**  
1. **Descriptive Statistics**:  
   - Summarized data using mean, median, min, max, and quartiles for each variable.
   - Frequency tables for categorical variables (gender and treatments).

2. **Correlation Analysis**:  
   - Correlation coefficients calculated between key variables (`ADWG0021`, `ADWG2150`, `ADWG0050`).

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:  
   - T-tests to compare means across gender and treatments.
   - Normality and homoscedasticity tested using Shapiro-Wilk test, Q-Q plots, Bartlett's test, and Leveneâ€™s test.
   - ANOVA and post-hoc testing (TukeyHSD and Bonferroni correction).

4. **Data Visualization**:  
   - **Histograms**: Visualized distribution of continuous variables (`ADWG0021`, `ADWG2150`).  
   - **Bar Charts**: Compared mean ADWG across genders.  
   - **Scatter Plots**: Displayed correlation with regression lines.  
   - **Boxplots**: Showed ADWG distribution across treatments.

## **Key Visualizations**
- **Bar Chart**: Mean ADWG (`ADWG0021`) for males and females.  
- **Histogram**: Distribution of `ADWG0021` and `ADWG2150`.  
- **Scatter Plot**: Correlation between `ADWG0021` and `ADWG0050`.  
- **Boxplot**: Comparison of ADWG across treatments A, B, C, D, and E.

## **File Descriptions**
- **FinalProject.R**: Contains all R scripts for data analysis and visualization.
- **documentation.docx**: Detailed project documentation, explaining each statistical method and the corresponding output.

## **Conclusion**  
The statistical analysis confirmed various insights into ADWG values across genders and treatments. While some variables showed strong correlations, others exhibited negligible differences, verified through hypothesis testing and ANOVA.
